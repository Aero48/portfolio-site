    <h1>Allegion Website</h1>
    <p>
      I utilized Adobe Experience Manager, Bootstrap, and media queries to
      develop a document library landing page for the current US Allegion
      website. I also helped make the home page on the site fully responsive.

    <h1>Jungle Cook</h1>
    <p>
      This was a collaborative project centered around creating a recipe browser
      CRUD application. The site allows you to create, edit and delete new
      recipes and loads page content dynamically.

    <h1>Eventsy</h1>
    <p>
      This is a front-end development project where I took a provided website
      layout and built a fully interactive website. The site utilizes HTML, CSS,
      JavaScript, and JQuery to dynamically load content.

    <h1>Health + Hygene</h1>
    <p>
      This was a simple front-end project focused on website responsiveness. The
      design for the site was made by Allison Johnson and I worked on the page's
      development.

    <h1>Gravitational Breakout</h1>
    <p>
      This is a small web game I made using the Javascript library p5.js. It
      takes the premise of pong and adds gravity and more complex collision
      detection.
