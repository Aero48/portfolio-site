    <h1>Kryptonite Website</h1>
    <p>
      I worked with a team to migrate the Kryptonite website content from an older version of Adobe Experience Manager to the latest. I authored many of the pages manually and ensured they were fully responsive and worked as intended.

    <h1>US Allegion Website</h1>
    <p>
      I utilized Adobe Experience Manager, Bootstrap, and media queries to
      develop a document library landing page for the current US Allegion
      website. I also helped make the home page on the site fully responsive.

    <h1>Jungle Cook</h1>
    <p>
      This was a collaborative project centered around creating a recipe browser
      CRUD application. The site allows you to create, edit and delete new
      recipes and loads page content dynamically.

    <h1>Gravitational Breakout</h1>
    <p>
      This is a small web game I made using the Javascript library p5.js. It
      takes the premise of pong and adds gravity and more complex collision
      detection.
